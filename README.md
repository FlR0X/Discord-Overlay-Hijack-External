# Discord-Overlay-Hijack-External
hijacks the discord overlay and draws imgui inside of it while remaining flagless due to the **NEW DISCORD OVERLA** being topmost and fullscreen + their devs being retarded

I used Wallpaper Engine as an example because I don't feel like opening Rust or FN right now, it works for any app with the **NEW DISCORD OVERLAY** not the legacy one injected.
